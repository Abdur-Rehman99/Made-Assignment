    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The retail industry, particularly supermarkets, is heavily influenced by external factors such as weather conditions. Understanding the relationship between weather patterns and Supershop sales is crucial for optimizing inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts. This project aims to explore the impact of weather on Supershop sales in three major cities in Myanmar: Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyitaw. The significance of understanding this correlation lies in its potential to revolutionize conventional strategies related to inventory management, pricing dynamics, and targeted marketing initiatives. By unraveling the interplay between weather nuances and purchasing trends, businesses can harness the power of predictive analytics to anticipate and respond to fluctuations in demand effectively. \n",

Following this, Section 3 elucidates the adopted methodology. Subsequently, Section 4 encompasses the presentation of the project's results. Finally, Section 5 comprises discussions, and remarks, and outlines avenues for future work in this project.\n"
