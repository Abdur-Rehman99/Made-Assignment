# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing Cost and Patterns in Electric Vehicle Data.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Is it possible to provide potential electric vehicle owners with better choices by carrying out a thorough analysis of a dataset on electric cars that includes insights into the overall cost of ownership over time, including purchase price and charging costs?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This projects aims to answer the questions for extensive costs for electric vehicle. It uses a vast dataset of existing electric vehciles and by applying Advance analytics and machine learning models. The goal of this project is to gather important information about the cost factors of this environmentally friendly form of transportation. The idea behind choosing this project was to analyze the cost data that provides insights into the total cost of ownership, which includes factors such as purchase price, charging costs, and maintenance expenses.


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource 1: Electric Vehicle Population Data
 
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunapro/electric-vehicle-population-data
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunapro/electric-vehicle-population-data/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset contains data on vehicles that are currently registered with the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) that are Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). This dataset was sourced from the data.gov website and aims to contribute to the understanding of electric vehicle adoption and distribution in Washington State.

### Datasource 2: EVs - One Electric Vehicle Dataset - Smaller

* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geoffnel/evs-one-electric-vehicle-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
* Data Type: CSV

This is a dataset of electric vehicles.

The mtcars dataset is among the most widely used data science datasets. It can be sued for analysis and visualization tasks.

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

TASK:

1. Clean and trasnform the dataset using pandas libarary fro using required columns [#1][i1]
2. Load the data set in python and SQLlite.
3. Develop Pipeline for the dataset.
4. Apply analytics and machine learning model.
