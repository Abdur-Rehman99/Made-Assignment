# Project Plan

## Summary

This project analyzes the transportation connectivity between cities in terms of car, train, and flight durations using your RDF knowledge graph. It also aims to investigate whether cities with better transportation connectivity have higher GDP or employment rates. This project also tries to explore other factors that might influence the relationship between transportation connectivity and economic indicators, such as population size or geographic location. 
## Rationale

The analysis helps to provide a more nuanced understanding of the role of transportation infrastructure in regional economic development.
