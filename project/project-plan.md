## Project Title: The Impact of EV Infrastructure on Carbon Emissions in Germany

# Project Plan

## Summary

The purpose of this research is to investigate the influence of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure on lowering carbon emissions in Germany. The study will look at the country's present EV charging infrastructure and its efficacy in boosting EV adoption. The research will also investigate new ways for extending and enhancing charging infrastructure in order to cut carbon emissions even more.

## Rationale

With increased concern about climate change and the need to minimize carbon emissions, electric vehicle adoption is considered as a critical answer. The availability and accessibility of charging infrastructure, on the other hand, is a crucial element in the adoption of EVs. This study can give significant information for policymakers and industry stakeholders in their efforts to promote sustainable mobility by assessing the impact of EV charging infrastructure on lowering carbon emissions in Germany.
