# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing India's Road Accident Issues from 2017 to 2020

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What are the main factors influencing the rate of road accidents across India's different regions from 2017 to 2020, and how can this analysis help  with specific measures to improve traffic safety?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

The goal of the project "Analyzing India's Road Accident Issues from 2017 to 2020" is to identify and address the factors that lead to the various types of road accidents that occur in India's different states. This project aims to gain insights into the primary causes of traffic accidents through analysis of patterns and correlations. This will allow specific measures to be developed in order to improve traffic safety.
