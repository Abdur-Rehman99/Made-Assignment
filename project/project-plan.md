## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The study "Evaluating the relationship between fatal road accidents and the death incidence in North Rhine-Westphalia" aims to comprehensively 
analyze the correlation between fatal road accidents and the resulting mortality rates within the region. Through a meticulous examination of available data, 
this research delves into the factors contributing to fatal accidents and their direct impact on the occurrence of fatalities. By focusing on North Rhine-Westphalia, 
the study aims to provide insights into the specific dynamics, patterns, and potential causal links between accidents and resulting deaths in this area. 
In order to provide practical options for avoiding accidents and lowering the death rate in the area, this study attempts to clarify the connection between traffic safety regulations, 
accident frequency, and the frequency of fatalities.


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Number of accidents by location - Country - Month
* Metadata URL: https://www.govdata.de/ckan/dataset/anzahl-der-unfalle-nach-ortslage-land-monat.rdf
* Data URL: https://www.landesdatenbank.nrw.de/ldbnrwws/downloader/00/tables/46241-06i_00.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The total number of road accidents that have occurred between 1995 and 2023 (as of date) is provided using the provided road accident dataset. 
It provides us with all the accents on  innerorts, außerorts (ohne Autobahnen)and Autobahnen.

### Datasource2: Deaths by sex and selected causes of death (84) - independent cities and districts - year
* Metadata URL: https://www.govdata.de/ckan/dataset/gestorbene-nach-geschlecht-und-ausgewahltentodesursachen-84-kreisfreie-stadte-und-kreise-jahr.rdf
* Data URL: https://www.landesdatenbank.nrw.de/ldbnrwws/downloader/00/tables/23211-03d_00.csv 
* Data Type: CSV

We can observe the overall number of deaths by category, sex, and corresponding city and state in the provided death patients dataset. I'll gather deaths from traffic accidents in Nordrhein-Westfalen.
