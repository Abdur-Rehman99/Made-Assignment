# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Casualty severity in the UK vehicle accidents

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Does the type of vehicle correlate with casualty severity?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Road safety is a global concern, demanding an understanding of factors contributing to accidents. Our focus lies on unraveling insights from road traffic accidents spanning 2009, 2015, and 2016, specifically examining how the "Type of vehicle" correlates with "Casualty severity".
This exploration seeks to inform interventions, shaping policies for enhanced road safety.
