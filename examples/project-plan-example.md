## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Weather Impact on Munich Bike Traffic
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How has the influence of weather on bike traffic patterns evolved over time in Munich ?

## Description
In Munich, we're looking at how the weather affects people using bikes at six specific spots. Biking is popular here, but does the weather influence when and how much people ride? This is an important problem because understanding how weather and bike traffic are connected can help us make the city better for biking. This project analyzes this connection, using method A. The results can give insights into how we can improve biking in Munich, encourage more people to ride, and make our city more environmentally friendly.

Identify statistical patterns and trends in parking violations.
Explore spatial distributions and correlations between parking violations and street characteristics.
5. Hotspot Identification:
Apply clustering or spatial analysis techniques to identify areas or streets with the highest frequency of parking violations.
Determine the criteria for defining parking violation hotspots based on the analysis results.
6. Visualization and Insights:
Create visualizations, such as maps or heatmaps, to illustrate the identified parking violation hotspots.
Generate data-driven insights and recommendations for urban planners, law enforcement agencies, and parking management companies.
Provide actionable recommendations for addressing parking violations in the identified hotspots.
7. Documentation and Reporting:
Document the project process, including data acquisition, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.
Present the results to stakeholders, highlighting the significance and potential impact of the analysis.
