# Project Plan

## Summary

This project aims to analyze correlations between popular songs (and their genres) and the weather conditions at the time the songs were popular. The project will attempt to identify possible relationships. Based on these, it will use the current weather conditions to suggest a "weather apropriate" song to the user.

## Rationale

The analysis will provide insights into the possible relationship between music and weather conditions. While the project is primarily intended as an entertaining exploration of these, it could also lead users toward discovering new music.

## Work Packages

<!-- TODO -->


**:warning: Disclaimer:** This project is intended as an amusing exercise in finding correlations and does not aim to prove a causal relationship between weather conditions and the popularity of particular songs or genres. The analysis is not intended to be scientifically rigorous and should not be construed as such.
